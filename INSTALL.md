The New Relic One nerdpack for Network Telemetry is based on data coming in
from a custom flow data integration available [here](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-network-telemetry).

## Requirements

## Collecting Data

Telemetry](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-network-telemetry) and validate that
you are able to see either `sflow` or `ipfix` custom Event Types in New Relic
Insights.
